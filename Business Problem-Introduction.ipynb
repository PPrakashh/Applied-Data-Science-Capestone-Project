So starting a business in a perfect landmark would be a toughest job for one with new business ideas.\n\nHere using the best ways of Data Science, using clustering algorithm-Battle Of Neighbourhoods, perfect spots to start several hot topic-business can be extracted at ease.\n\nThe following project helps people to start a Hotel, Gym, Shopping Mall etc in a perfect spot as wished.\n\nThe **Foursquare API** is used to access the venues in the neighbourhoods.\n\nThe Foursquare Places API provides location based experiences with diverse information about venues, users, photos, and check-ins.\n\nHere only a min amount of venues ar obtaines. So we analyse areas with countable no. of venues.\n\n**k-means Clustering Algorithm :** used to undergo Clustering of Neighbourhoods. \n\n**Silhouette Score :** Gives optimal number of clusters.\n\n**Folium visualization library :** Used to visualize the clusters superimposed on the map of Chennai city."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.7", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.7.10", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 2}
